# Ciphers
Create ciphers with various levels of difficulty to solve

This project will provide a resource for ttrpg GM's who want to use ciphers in their games. 

Just type in the phrase you want the cipher to solve to and this will return an easy to solve cipher, a medium difficulty cipher, and a hard cipher, as well as the keys to solve then.

the easy cipher is a substitution cipher specifically the rot-13 cipher https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher

the medium cipher is a Permutation Ciphers which is a fancy name for a word scramble https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher

the hard cipher will be the Caesar Cipher https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher
